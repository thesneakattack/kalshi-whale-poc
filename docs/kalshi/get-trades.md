# Get Trades

> Endpoint for getting all trades for all markets. A trade represents a completed transaction between two users on a specific market. Each trade includes the market ticker, price, quantity, and timestamp information. Block trades are included in the response by default and identified by the `is_block_trade` field; use the `is_block_trade` query parameter to filter by block / non-block. This endpoint returns a paginated response. Use the 'limit' parameter to control page size (1-1000, defaults to 100). The response includes a 'cursor' field - pass this value in the 'cursor' parameter of your next request to get the next page. An empty cursor indicates no more pages are available.

            See [Order direction](/getting_started/order_direction). This field
            will not be removed before May 14, 2026.

            The outcome side the taker is positioned for. buy-yes and sell-no

            `taker_outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does
            not change the trade's price. A trade at price `p` with
            `taker_outcome_side=no` is matched against the maker at the same
            price `p` with the opposite direction — both parties trade at the
            same price.


            `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side` will become the canonical
            way to determine trade direction. The legacy `taker_side` field will
            be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to these new
            fields.
        taker_book_side:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/BookSide'
          description: >
            Same directional bit as taker_outcome_side in book vocabulary. 'bid'
            is equivalent to taker_outcome_side 'yes'; 'ask' is equivalent to
            taker_outcome_side 'no'.


            `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side` will become the canonical
            way to determine trade direction. The legacy `taker_side` field will
            be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to these new
            fields.
        created_time:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: Timestamp when this trade was executed
        is_block_trade:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            True if this trade was matched off-book as a block trade (e.g. via
            RFQ / negotiated block proposal); false for trades that filled on
            the standard order book.
    FixedPointCount:
      type: string
      description: >-
        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred
        to as "fp" in field names). Requests accept 0-2 decimal places (e.g.,
        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Fractional
        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported; the minimum granularity is
        0.01 contracts.
      example: '10.00'
    FixedPointDollars:
      type: string
      description: >-
        Fixed-point US dollar string. Most request fields accept 2-4 decimal
        places (e.g., "0.56", "0.5600"); responses emit up to 6. Valid quote
        intervals for a given market are constrained by that market's price
        level structure.
      example: '0.5600'
    BookSide:
      type: string
      enum:
        - bid
        - ask
      description: >-
        Side of the book for an order or trade. For event markets, this refers
        to the YES leg only: `bid` means buy YES, `ask` means sell YES. (Selling
        YES is economically equivalent to buying NO at `1 - price`, but this
        endpoint quotes everything from the YES side.)
