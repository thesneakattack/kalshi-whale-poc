# Get Historical Positions

>  Endpoint for getting settled market positions that have been archived to the historical database. Positions whose markets were archived before `market_positions_last_updated_ts` on `GET /historical/cutoff` are available via this endpoint. Positions are archived per whole event: a settled event's positions move here together and are never split between this endpoint and `GET /portfolio/positions`. Unsettled positions are always available via `GET /portfolio/positions`.
