# Get Historical Trades

>  Endpoint for getting all historical trades for all markets. Trades that were filled before the historical cutoff are available via this endpoint. Block trades are included by default and identified by the `is_block_trade` field; use the `is_block_trade` query parameter to filter by block / non-block. See [Historical Data](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/historical_data) for details.

            will not be removed before May 14, 2026.
        taker_outcome_side:
          type: string

            The outcome side the taker is positioned for. buy-yes and sell-no

            `taker_outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does
            not change the trade's price. A trade at price `p` with
            `taker_outcome_side=no` is matched against the maker at the same
            price `p` with the opposite direction — both parties trade at the
            same price.


            `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side` will become the canonical
            way to determine trade direction. The legacy `taker_side` field will
            be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to these new
            fields.
        taker_book_side:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/BookSide'
          description: >
            Same directional bit as taker_outcome_side in book vocabulary. 'bid'
            is equivalent to taker_outcome_side 'yes'; 'ask' is equivalent to
            taker_outcome_side 'no'.


            `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side` will become the canonical
            way to determine trade direction. The legacy `taker_side` field will
            be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to these new

            True if this trade was matched off-book as a block trade (e.g. via
            RFQ / negotiated block proposal); false for trades that filled on
            the standard order book.

    FixedPointCount:

      description: >-
        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred
        to as "fp" in field names). Requests accept 0-2 decimal places (e.g.,
        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Fractional
        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported; the minimum granularity is
        0.01 contracts.
      example: '10.00'
    FixedPointDollars:
      type: string
      description: >-
        Fixed-point US dollar string. Most request fields accept 2-4 decimal
        places (e.g., "0.56", "0.5600"); responses emit up to 6. Valid quote
        intervals for a given market are constrained by that market's price
        level structure.
      example: '0.5600'

      description: >-
        Side of the book for an order or trade. For event markets, this refers
        to the YES leg only: `bid` means buy YES, `ask` means sell YES. (Selling
        YES is economically equivalent to buying NO at `1 - price`, but this
        endpoint quotes everything from the YES side.)
