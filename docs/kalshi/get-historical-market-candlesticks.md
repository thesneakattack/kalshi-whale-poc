        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred

        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Fractional
        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported; the minimum granularity is
        0.01 contracts.
      example: '10.00'
    FixedPointDollars:

        Fixed-point US dollar string. Most request fields accept 2-4 decimal
        places (e.g., "0.56", "0.5600"); responses emit up to 6. Valid quote
        intervals for a given market are constrained by that market's price
        level structure.
      example: '0.5600'
