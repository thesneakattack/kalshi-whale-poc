        Scope granted to an API key. Parent scopes grant broad access; for
        example, `read` grants all read endpoints and `write` grants all write
        endpoints. Child scopes such as `read::block_trade_accept`,
        `read::portfolio_balance`, `write::trade`, `write::transfer`, and
        `write::block_trade_accept` grant only their specific endpoint group and
        can be granted without the parent scope.
