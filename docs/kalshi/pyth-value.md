# Pyth Value Feed

  Real-time Pyth price updates for configured underlying tickers. Requires
  authentication.


  **Requirements:**

  - Authentication required

  - Seed `underlying_tickers` in the initial subscribe, or add them later

  - Use `underlying_tickers: ["all"]` to receive every available underlying

  - Supports `update_subscription` with `subscribe_underlyings`,
  `unsubscribe_underlyings`, and `underlying_list` actions

  - Duplicate and out-of-order source timestamps are ignored independently per
  underlying ticker


  Subscribe without `underlying_tickers` to create an empty subscription, then
  use `underlying_list`

  to discover recently streamed underlyings and `subscribe_underlyings` to
  receive prices.
