# Get FCM Subtrader Risk Controls

> Returns the initial margin caps configured for an FCM member's subtrader on the margined
exchange. A cap with neither market_ticker nor asset_class applies across all markets; the
remaining caps are scoped to a single market or a single asset class each. Every cap in
scope for an order is enforced independently. Markets without a cap are omitted.
