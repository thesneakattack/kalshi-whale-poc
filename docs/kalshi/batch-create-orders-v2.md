# Batch Create Orders (V2)

> Endpoint for submitting a batch of event-market orders using the V2 request/response shape. The maximum batch size scales with your tier's write budget — see [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits).

<Note>
  **Rate limit:** 10 tokens per order in the batch — billed per item, so total cost for a batch of N orders is N × 10. See `GET /trade-api/v2/account/endpoint_costs` for current non-default endpoint costs.
