# Intra Account Transfer

> Transfers funds within the same account.

When `source_exchange_shard` and `destination_exchange_shard` are the same, Kalshi treats the request as a subaccount transfer. The returned transfer ID appears in the subaccount transfer history.

Cross-exchange-index subaccount transfers run in up to three non-atomic steps. If a later step fails, completed steps are not undone, so funds may remain in the primary account on the source or destination exchange index.

        When `source_exchange_shard` and `destination_exchange_shard` are the
        same, Kalshi treats the request as a subaccount transfer. The returned
        transfer ID appears in the subaccount transfer history.


        Cross-exchange-index subaccount transfers run in up to three non-atomic
        steps. If a later step fails, completed steps are not undone, so funds
        may remain in the primary account on the source or destination exchange
        index.
