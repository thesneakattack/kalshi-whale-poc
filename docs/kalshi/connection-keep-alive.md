# Connection Keep-Alive

> WebSocket control frames for connection management.

Kalshi sends Ping frames (`0x9`) every 10 seconds with body `heartbeat` to maintain the connection.
Clients should respond with Pong frames (`0xA`). Clients may also send Ping frames to which Kalshi will respond with Pong.
