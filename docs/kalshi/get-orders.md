# Get Orders

> Restricts the response to orders that have a certain status: resting, canceled, or executed.
Orders that have been canceled or fully executed before the historical cutoff are only available via `GET /historical/orders`. Resting orders will always be available through this endpoint. See [Historical Data](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/historical_data) for details.

            `outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does not
            change the order's price. An order at price `p` with
            `outcome_side=no` is matched by an order at the same price `p` with
            `outcome_side=yes` — both parties trade at the same price, just on
            opposite directions.


            `outcome_side` and `book_side` will become the canonical way to
            determine order direction. The legacy `action`, `side`, and `is_yes`
            fields will be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to
            these new fields.
