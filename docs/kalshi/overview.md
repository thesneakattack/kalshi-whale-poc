# Kalshi SDKs

> Official Python and TypeScript SDKs for the Kalshi API

Kalshi publishes Python and TypeScript SDKs to help you get started quickly.

<Warning>
  SDKs are updated periodically and may lag the API. Active traders should treat the REST [OpenAPI specification](https://docs.kalshi.com/openapi.yaml) and WebSocket [AsyncAPI specification](https://docs.kalshi.com/asyncapi.yaml) as the source of truth. For production, we recommend generating your own client from those specs — or integrating directly — for full control over your implementation.
</Warning>

</Note>

SDK releases track the [OpenAPI specification](https://docs.kalshi.com/openapi.yaml) and are generally published Tuesday–Wednesday each week, ahead of the corresponding API changes; check the package pages and the [API Changelog](/changelog) for updates. All SDKs authenticate with an API key and RSA-PSS request signing — see [API Keys](/getting_started/api_keys) for setup.
