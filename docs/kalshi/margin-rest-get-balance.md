# Get Balance

> Endpoint for retrieving the balance breakdown for the authenticated direct margin user. Returns cash balance (aggregate and per-subaccount), position value, total balance, and maintenance margin requirement.

<Note>
  **Rate limit:** 5 tokens per request, or 50 tokens when `compute_available_balance=true` (the available-balance computation scans all resting orders). See `GET /trade-api/v2/account/endpoint_costs` for current non-default endpoint costs.
</Note>
