# CF Benchmarks Value Feed

> Real-time CF Benchmarks index value updates, each carrying the raw upstream frame plus trailing 60-second and quarter-hour final-minute averages. Requires authentication.

**Requirements:**
- Authentication required
- Index specification via `index_ids` (array of CF Benchmarks index IDs, for example `["BRTI", "ETHUSD_RTI"]`)
- `market_ticker`/`market_tickers`/`market_id`/`market_ids` are not supported for this channel
- You can seed `index_ids` in the initial subscribe, or subscribe first and add indices later
- Use `index_ids: ["all"]` to receive every available index
- Supports `update_subscription` with `subscribe_indices` / `unsubscribe_indices` / `indexlist` actions
- `indexlist` returns the available index IDs (as a `cfbenchmarks_value_indexlist` message) without modifying the subscription
- Ticks are emitted roughly once per second; duplicate or out-of-order upstream source timestamps are ignored

**Use case:** Consuming CF Benchmarks reference index values and their short-window averages

**Subscription workflow:**
1. Subscribe to `cfbenchmarks_value` (optionally seeding `index_ids`). A successful subscribe returns a `subscribed` response with the assigned `sid`.
2. Discover available index IDs with the `indexlist` action; the server replies with a `cfbenchmarks_value_indexlist` message.
3. Add or remove tracked index IDs with `subscribe_indices` / `unsubscribe_indices`, or use `index_ids: ["all"]` to track everything.

**Averaging semantics:**

`avg_60s_data` (always present):
- Window is trailing and per tick: `[source_ts_ms - 60000, source_ts_ms)`
- `window_size` counts prior ticks only
- If there are no prior ticks in the trailing window, the average falls back to the current tick value

`last_60s_windowed_average_15min` (present only in the final minute before quarter-hour close: `:00`, `:15`, `:30`, `:45`):
- Active accumulation window is `(quarter_close_ts_ms - 60000, quarter_close_ts_ms]`
- The start-boundary tick is excluded and the close tick is included
- This produces second-indexed counts: `:01 -> 1`, `:14 -> 14`, `:59 -> 59`, close tick (`:00/:15/:30/:45`) -> `60`
- The field is omitted outside that final-minute window

**Integration notes:**
- If you subscribe without any `index_ids`, no value events flow until you add indices or switch to `["all"]`
- `sid` identifies the subscription stream; use it for `update_subscription` and `unsubscribe`
- Missing `index_ids` for `subscribe_indices`/`unsubscribe_indices` returns an `error` with `code: 24` ("Index IDs required"); unsupported actions return a standard websocket `error`

                Unique ID of the command request. Generated by the client and
                should be unique within a WS session.

                The simplest way to use it would be to start from 1 and then
                increment the value for every new command sent to the server.

                If the id is set to 0, the server treats it the same way as if
                there was no id.
