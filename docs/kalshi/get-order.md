            `outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does not
            change the order's price. An order at price `p` with
            `outcome_side=no` is matched by an order at the same price `p` with
            `outcome_side=yes` — both parties trade at the same price, just on
            opposite directions.


            `outcome_side` and `book_side` will become the canonical way to
            determine order direction. The legacy `action`, `side`, and `is_yes`
            fields will be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to
            these new fields.

            Same directional bit as outcome_side in book vocabulary. 'bid' is
            equivalent to outcome_side 'yes'; 'ask' is equivalent to
            outcome_side 'no'.
