# RFQ

> Request for Quote functionality for RFQ creators and market makers

## Overview

RFQ functionality involves two types of participants connecting via different FIX sessions:

**RFQ Creators** - Users who want to trade via RFQ (connect via **RT mode**):

1. Create RFQ via QuoteRequest (35=R)
2. Receive quotes from market makers via Quote (35=S)
3. Accept a quote via AcceptQuote (35=UA)
4. Receive trade execution via ExecutionReport (35=8)

**Market Makers** - Users who provide quotes (connect via **RfqMode**):

1. Receive QuoteRequest from exchange
2. Respond with Quote (35=S)
3. Receive acceptance notification
4. Confirm execution via QuoteConfirm (35=U7)

<Info>
  RFQ Creators use the KalshiRT endpoint (same as order entry), which provides message persistence and retransmission support. Market Makers use the KalshiRFQ endpoint to receive RFQ broadcasts and submit quotes.

<Note>
  The delimiter is the first tag of a group entry: send `146`, then `55` for a symbol RFQ
  or `38`/`152` for an MVE RFQ (which omits `55`). Note that `21015` and `21016` are
  dropped without a reject if they land outside the group — a misplaced `21016` surfaces
  later as `RFQ already exists` on the next request rather than as an error on this one.

  The published [FIX dictionary](https://assets.kalshi.com/fix/kalshi-fix-dictionary.xml)
  lists `55` first, since a dictionary can only declare one delimiter per group. MVE
  requests legitimately omit `55`, so a strict dictionary-driven validator may flag them —
  relax the delimiter for the MVE case rather than adding an empty `55`.
</Note>

<Info>
  **MVE/Parlay Support**: Instead of specifying a Symbol, you can submit MVE legs directly. The server will automatically resolve or create the parlay market and return the resolved market ticker in the QuoteRequestAck.
</Info>

### Exchange → Market Maker (RFQ Notification)

The exchange builds this message with the same structure market makers must parse:
`55`, `38`, `152` and the nested `453=NoPartyIDs` group are members of the
`146=NoRelatedSym` group, and the MVE tags sit in the message body.

**Message body**

<Note>
  The server-assigned RFQ ID is returned in tag 21023. Store it if you want to reconcile later Quote or QuoteStatusReport messages to the created RFQ. RFQCancel accepts either your original client-assigned QuoteReqId (tag 131) or the server-assigned RfqId (tag 21023).
</Note>

<Info>
  When creating an RFQ with MVE legs instead of a Symbol, the resolved market ticker is returned in tag 55. This is the market that was created or looked up based on your leg selection.
</Info>

## Quote (35=S)

This message is used bidirectionally:

* **Market Maker → Exchange**: Submit a quote for an RFQ
* **Exchange → Creator**: Notify creator of a new quote

If a new Quote is created when an existing quote for the same market already exists for the user, the exchange will cancel the existing quote.

<Warning>
  Either BidPx or OfferPx can be zero, but not both. Zero indicates no quote for that side.

## QuoteStatusReport (35=AI)

A QuoteStatusReport is sent by the exchange:

1. In response to a Quote. Status will be PENDING if processed, or REJECTED if rejected
2. When the requester accepts the quote. Status will be ACCEPTED
3. In response to a QuoteCancel. Status will be CANCELLED
