# Get Weather Index

> Get the Kalshi-computed city temperature index: the canonical minute-resolution series behind hourly temperature markets. City-keyed and independent of any event — the series exists whenever the city's index is configured. Values are Fahrenheit rounded to 0.01. Minutes where the index quorum failed carry no value and are never returned as points, so gaps in the series are real gaps. With `detailed=true` each point additionally carries every member station's reported reading and quality-control disposition — the pre-incorporation breakdown.

        Get the Kalshi-computed city temperature index: the canonical
        minute-resolution series behind hourly temperature markets. City-keyed
        and independent of any event — the series exists whenever the city's
        index is configured. Values are Fahrenheit rounded to 0.01. Minutes
        where the index quorum failed carry no value and are never returned as
        points, so gaps in the series are real gaps. With `detailed=true` each
        point additionally carries every member station's reported reading and
        quality-control disposition — the pre-incorporation breakdown.

            recorded so far (code `pending`, not yet quality-controlled — more
            readings may still arrive, and the canonical value may differ).
