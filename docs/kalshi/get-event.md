# Get Event

> Endpoint for getting data about an event by its ticker. An event represents a real-world occurrence that can be traded on, such as an election, sports game, or economic indicator release.
Events contain one or more markets where users can place trades on different outcomes.
All events are accessible through this endpoint, even if their associated markets are older than the historical cutoff.
