# Get Historical Cutoff Timestamps

> Returns the cutoff timestamps that define the boundary between **live** and **historical** data.

## Cutoff fields
- `market_settled_ts` : Markets that **settled** before this timestamp, and their candlesticks, must be accessed via `GET /historical/markets` and `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`.
- `trades_created_ts` : Trades that were **filled** before this timestamp must be accessed via `GET /historical/fills`.
- `orders_updated_ts` : Orders that were **canceled or fully executed** before this timestamp must be accessed via `GET /historical/orders`. Resting (active) orders are always available in `GET /portfolio/orders`.
- `market_positions_last_updated_ts` : Settled positions **archived from the live data set** before this timestamp must be accessed via `GET /historical/positions`. Unsettled positions are always available in `GET /portfolio/positions`.
