            `outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does not
            change the fill's price. A fill at price `p` with `outcome_side=no`
            is matched against an order at the same price `p` with
            `outcome_side=yes` — both parties trade at the same price, just on
            opposite directions.


            `outcome_side` and `book_side` will become the canonical way to
            determine fill direction. The legacy `action` and `side` fields will
            be deprecated in a future release — please migrate to these new
            fields.

        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported; the minimum granularity is

        intervals for a given market are constrained by that market's price
