# Get Funding Rate Estimate

> Returns the estimated funding rate for the current, in-progress funding period. The value is a time-weighted average of the premium index computed over `[last_funding_time, now)`, so it continues to move as new data accumulates through the window and is only finalized at `next_funding_time`.
