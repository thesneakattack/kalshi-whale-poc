            The caller's active API usage level grants across exchange lanes,

    BucketLimit:
      type: object
      description: |
        Token-bucket budget for one rate-limit bucket. Each request deducts
        tokens equal to its endpoint cost; the bucket refills at refill_rate
        tokens per second up to bucket_capacity. A request is allowed if the
        bucket holds enough tokens to cover its cost; otherwise the request
        is rejected with HTTP 429.
      required:
        - refill_rate
        - bucket_capacity
      properties:
        refill_rate:

          description: Tokens added to the bucket per second.
        bucket_capacity:
          type: integer
          description: |
            Maximum tokens the bucket can hold. When equal to refill_rate the
            bucket holds one second of budget; larger values represent burst
            headroom that idle clients accumulate and can spend in a single
            pulse (e.g. write buckets at non-Basic tiers hold two seconds of
            budget).
