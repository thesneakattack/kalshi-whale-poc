# Amend Order (V2)

> Endpoint for amending the price and/or max fillable count of an existing event-market order using the V2 request/response shape. The request `count` is the updated total/max fillable count, equal to already filled count plus desired resting remaining count. This behavior matches the v1 amend endpoints; only the request/response shape differs.

<Note>
  Amending a resting order preserves queue position only when the amendment decreases size. All other amendments — like increasing size or changing price forfeit queue position and place the order at the back of the queue.

    FixedPointDollars:

        Fixed-point US dollar string. Most request fields accept 2-4 decimal
        places (e.g., "0.56", "0.5600"); responses emit up to 6. Valid quote
        intervals for a given market are constrained by that market's price
        level structure.
      example: '0.5600'
    FixedPointCount:

      description: >-
        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred
        to as "fp" in field names). Requests accept 0-2 decimal places (e.g.,
        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Fractional
        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported; the minimum granularity is
        0.01 contracts.
