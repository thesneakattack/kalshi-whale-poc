# API Changelog

> Stay updated with API changes and version history

You can subscribe to the RSS changelog at `/changelog/rss.xml` if you'd like to stay ahead of breaking changes.

This changelog is a work in progress. As always, we welcome any feedback in our Discord #dev channel!

This changelog covers Kalshi's REST, WebSocket, and FIX APIs across both the
Predictions and Margin exchanges. Use the entry tags to filter by API
surface (`REST`, `WebSocket`, `FIX`) or exchange (`Predictions`, `Margin`).
FIX API changes, previously tracked on a separate page, now live here under
the `FIX` tag.

  New endpoint: `GET /trade-api/v2/live_data/weather/{city}` serves the
  Kalshi-computed city temperature index — the canonical minute-resolution
  series behind hourly temperature markets (`miami` first). Values are
  Fahrenheit rounded to 0.01; minutes where the index quorum failed are
  omitted, so gaps are real gaps. Window via `from`/`to` (unix ms) or
  `last_sec`, defaulting to the trailing 24 hours. With `detailed=true`,
  each point carries every member station's reported reading and
  quality-control disposition before incorporation into the index, and
  trailing minutes still inside the receipt deadline are additionally
  served as `incomplete` points: no index value (`v` is absent, not `0`),
  with the raw, not-yet-quality-controlled station readings recorded so
  far (station code `pending`).

  Multivariate (combo) markets are moving from `deci_cent` (a uniform \$0.001
  tick) to `center_deci_edge_centi_cent`: \$0.0001 (0.01¢) ticks below \$0.01
  and above \$0.99, with \$0.001 (0.1¢) ticks in between. Other markets are
  unchanged.

  No API fields or message formats change. Prices below \$0.01 and above
  \$0.99 use all four decimal places of the existing `*_dollars` fields — read
  prices from those fields (integer-cent fields cannot represent sub-cent
  prices) and snap order and RFQ quote prices to the `step` of the band
  containing the price in the market's `price_ranges` array rather than keying
  off the structure name.

  Existing combo markets migrate in place with resting orders preserved. After
  this release every combo market is on `center_deci_edge_centi_cent`. See
  [Fixed-Point Representation](/getting_started/fixed_point_migration) for the
  full structure reference.

  As a result of trader feedback, the formerly announced planned change to
  remove `post-only` on quotes is cancelled. This flag will be preserved.

  However, to protect against "locked" markets which can occur if a quoter
  with post-only repeatedly crosses the book, quoters with post-only set to
  true may be temporarily rate limited if they cross several times in short
  succession.

  The formerly announced change adjusting maker and taker fees in the event a
  quoter matches against a recently placed resting order will proceed as

  For combo trades, if a quoter executes against an order that has rested on
  the book for less than five seconds, both parties' fees will be adjusted: the
  quoter will pay the maker fee, and the resting counterparty will pay the
  taker fee. The maker fee uses a fee multiplier of `0.5`, rather than the
  standard `0.25`. See the
  [Kalshi Fee Schedule](https://kalshi.com/fee-schedule) for details.

  Sub-account-restricted API keys can now use the
  [communications endpoints](/api-reference/communications) and create combo
  markets, scoped to the key's locked sub-account: omitting `subaccount` acts
  on the locked sub-account, any other sub-account is rejected, and a
  different sub-account's RFQs and quotes cannot be read in detail or acted
  on. Scoping matches rows created through the API; web-created RFQs are not
  addressable per sub-account. The `write::trade` scope is now sufficient for
  `POST /multivariate_event_collections/{collection_ticker}` (parent `write`
  keys are unaffected). On FIX, restricted sessions still support the maker
  quote lifecycle only; block-trade endpoints also remain unavailable to
  restricted keys.

<Update
  label="August 20, 2026"
  tags={["REST", "Margin"]}
  rss={{
title: "Exit triggers on margin positions",
description: "New REST endpoints to set, read, and cancel stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing-stop triggers on margin positions."
}}
>
  Stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing-stop triggers on margin positions are now available
  over REST:

  * `PUT`, `GET`, and `DELETE` on `/trade-api/v2/margin/isolated/positions/{ticker}/exit_trigger`
  * `PUT`, `GET`, and `DELETE` on `/trade-api/v2/margin/cross/positions/{ticker}/exit_trigger`
  * `PUT` and `DELETE` on `/trade-api/v2/margin/cross/positions/{ticker}/exit_trigger/{trigger_id}`

  A position holds at most one live `trailing` stop. Non-isolated positions may hold up to 20
  live `bracket` (stop-loss / take-profit) triggers at once, so long as their counts fit the
  position. Isolated positions hold one. `kind` selects the family: on `GET` and `DELETE`,
  omitting it covers both, while a `PUT` without one writes a `bracket`. Orders fired by a
  trigger are reduce-only.

  Order-anchored triggers return to `pending_on_entry` after closing their current quantity,
  because the anchor order can still add fills — so `status` is not monotonic, and only a
  `filled` trigger with no `anchor_order_id` is done. A `count` or `anchor_order_id` create
  appends a trigger, so it requires `client_trigger_id` and replaying one returns the trigger
  the first request made; the key belongs to the position it created on, and reusing it for
  another position returns `409` rather than that position's trigger.

  Non-isolated positions take a `subaccount`, and additionally support partial triggers via
  `count`, triggers tied to an order via `anchor_order_id`, and the `{trigger_id}` routes for
  managing one of several triggers on the same position. Isolated positions hold a single
  trigger per kind and always close in full. A supplied `count` must be a whole number of
  contracts.

  If an anchor order cannot currently be validated, its trigger request returns `409` with
  error code `anchor_order_unavailable` before writing a trigger. Retrying that response is safe.

  When an RFQ (`35=R`) selects legs that form an invalid multivariate

  * `Text` (58): a human-readable explanation of why the combination is
    invalid.

    tickers, each entry carrying `MVEOffendingMarketTicker` (20186).

  A new endpoint, `GET /trade-api/v2/live_data/events/{event_ticker}`, returns
  live data keyed by event ticker — previously only available on the internal
  API. It serves event-keyed live data such as crypto price charts (e.g.
  `KXBTC15M` events), commodity price timeseries, and weather observations.

  The response's `live_data.type` field names the schema of the flexible
  `live_data.details` object. An optional `range` query parameter (e.g.
  `15min`, `1h`, `1d`) restricts the returned timeseries window where the
  underlying live data type supports it.

  Every quote is pinned to the key's subaccount: on `Quote (35=S)`, an omitted

  Seven new `price_level_structure` values are being introduced:

  `center_{center}_edge_{edge}_cent`, where `whole` = 1¢, `half` = 0.5¢,
  `quint` = 0.2¢, and `deci` = 0.1¢. Edge bands are \$0.00–\$0.10 and
  \$0.90–\$1.00; the center band is \$0.10–\$0.90. Existing values
  (`linear_cent`, `tapered_deci_cent`, `deci_cent`) are unchanged.

  There are no new fields and no new decimal precision. The source of truth
  for a market's valid prices remains the `price_ranges` array on the market
  object (`{ start, end, step }` bands in fixed-point dollars) — consume it
  dynamically per market rather than keying logic off the
  `price_level_structure` label. Structure changes are delivered on the
  existing `market_lifecycle_v2` WebSocket channel via the existing
  `price_level_structure_updated` event, which includes the updated
  `price_ranges`. When a market moves to a finer tick, resting orders are
  preserved and carried over to the new grid.

  Rollout: pilot markets switch to the new structures the week of
  July 27, 2026, scheduled to avoid disrupting actively-trading markets,
  with expansion to higher-volume markets the week of August 3, 2026.

  with a price the market does not accept, for example a sub-tick price on a
  market that does not support fractional prices.

  These rejects now report the underlying reason in `Text<58>`, with a
  corresponding `CxlRejReason<102>`:

  * Invalid price (off-tick, out-of-band, `$0`, or `$1`): `Text<58>=INVALID_PRICE`, `CxlRejReason<102>=99` (Other)

  Effective immediately, RFQ quotes are no longer guaranteed to remain queryable
  unless they have reached a post-acceptance state: `accepted`, `confirmed`, or

  open quote is cleared during a server roll or restart, it should be treated as
  effectively cancelled and no longer actionable, even if there is no queryable
  cancelled quote record. Later requests for that quote may return
  `404 Not Found`.

  Clients should store the RFQ ID returned for each RFQ and include it alongside
  the quote ID when performing quote actions. REST now supports RFQ-scoped quote
  action endpoints using `rfq_id` as a path parameter:

  `QuoteId<117>` on `QuoteCancel (35=Z)`, `QuoteConfirm (35=U7)`, and

  to that RFQ; when it is omitted, the exchange will continue to resolve the RFQ

  We expect `rfq_id` / `RfqId<21023>` to become required for quote actions in a

  You can now restrict an API key to a single sub-account when you create it.
  Pass `subaccount` (0-63) to `POST /api_keys` or `POST /api_keys/generate`. A

  target another sub-account are rejected, and the key cannot transfer funds

  REST and FIX order-entry or market-data sessions; they cannot open WebSocket,
  FIX listener, drop-copy, RFQ, or retransmission sessions. `GET /api_keys`
  returns each key's `subaccount` (absent when the key is unrestricted). Omit

  In certain uncommon cases, responses from `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}` and `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/amend` do not describe the order that was cancelled or amended — the `order_id`, `client_order_id`, and quantity fields (`reduced_by_centicount`, `remaining_centicount`, fill fields) in the response may not correspond to your request. The cancel or amend itself executes correctly against the intended order; only the response body is affected. Downstream order and position state are correct.

  As a result, the previously announced rate-limit cost bump on the legacy `/portfolio/orders*` endpoints is delayed until May 21.

}}
>
  Order, Fill, and Trade responses now include two new normalized direction
  fields. Each carries the full directional bit on its own — combining
  `action` with `side` is no longer required to know what the user is
  positioned for. The two fields encode the same bit in two vocabularies:
  `bid` is equivalent to `yes`, `ask` is equivalent to `no`.

  * `outcome_side` (`yes` | `no`) — the outcome the user profits from.
    Buy-yes and sell-no produce `yes`; buy-no and sell-yes produce `no`.
  * `book_side` (`bid` | `ask`) — same bit in book vocabulary.

  Affected REST responses (`svc-api2`):

  * `Order` (GetOrders, GetOrder, GetHistoricalOrders, and order-write responses)
  * `Fill` (GetFills, GetFillsHistorical)
  * `Trade` (public) — fields are named `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side` to match the existing `taker_side`

  Affected WebSocket channels (`apiexternal-ws`):

  * `user_orders`
  * `fill`
  * `trade` — `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side`

  `outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does not change
  the order's price. An order at price `p` with `outcome_side=no` is
  matched by an order at the same price `p` with `outcome_side=yes` —
  both parties trade at the same price, just on opposite directions.

  Existing `action`, `side`, `is_yes`, `purchased_side`, and `taker_side`
  fields are now marked deprecated. `outcome_side` and `book_side` are
  the canonical way to determine order/trade direction going forward.
  The legacy fields **will not be removed before May 28, 2026** — please
  migrate to the new fields when integrating against these endpoints.

  page for the full migration table and equivalence rules.

  Kalshi now partitions exchange data into **live** and **historical** tiers. Historical data must be accessed via the new historical API endpoints. The `GET /historical/cutoff` endpoint returns the cutoff timestamps that define this boundary.

  **Cutoff timestamps and what they mean:**

  * `market_settled_ts` — partitioned by **market settlement time**. Markets and their candlesticks that settled before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/markets` and `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`.
  * `trades_created_ts` — partitioned by **trade fill time**. Fills that occurred before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/fills`.
  * `orders_updated_ts` — partitioned by **order cancellation or execution time**. Orders canceled or fully executed before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/orders`. **Resting (active) orders are unaffected** and always appear in `GET /portfolio/orders`.

  **New endpoints:**

  * `GET /historical/cutoff` — returns the market, trade, and order cutoff timestamps
  * `GET /historical/markets` — settled markets older than the cutoff
  * `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}` — single historical market by ticker
  * `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks` — candlestick data for historical markets
  * `GET /historical/fills` — trade fills older than the cutoff

  The `client_order_id` and `updated_client_order_id` fields in amend order requests are now optional.

  **Behavior changes:**

  * You can now amend orders without providing `client_order_id` fields by using only the `order_id` from the URL path
  * If you provide an `updated_client_order_id`, the order can be found by the exchange and the `client_order_id` updated just on `order_id` alone

  **Affected endpoint:**

  **Example:**

  ```json theme={null}
  {
    "ticker": "MARKET-TICKER",
    "side": "yes",
    "action": "buy",
    "count_fp": "50.00",

  Added sharding support to the `communications` WebSocket channel for high-throughput RFQ/quote consumers.

  **New subscription parameters:**

  * `shard_factor` (int): Number of shards to divide messages across (e.g., 4)
  * `shard_key` (int): Which shard this connection receives (0 to shard\_factor-1)

  Messages are sharded by `market_ticker` using consistent hashing. Clients can run multiple connections with different `shard_key` values to distribute load while ensuring complete coverage.

  **Validation:**

  * `shard_factor` must be > 0 when provided
  * `shard_key` must be >= 0 and \< `shard_factor`
  * `shard_key` requires `shard_factor` to be set

  **Example subscription:**

  ```json theme={null}
  {
    "id": 1,
    "cmd": "subscribe",
    "params": {
      "channels": ["communications"],
      "shard_factor": 4,

  1. **Past expiration timestamps now rejected**: Orders with `expiration_ts` in the past will be rejected with error "Expiration timestamp must be in the future" instead of being automatically converted to IoC orders.

  2. **IoC + expiration\_ts combination rejected**: Orders cannot specify both `time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel"` and `expiration_ts`. This will be rejected at the API level with error "Cannot specify both immediate\_or\_cancel and expiration\_ts".

  3. **IoC orders no longer support expiration**: The IoC order type is now independent and does not accept an expiration timestamp.

  **Migration guide**: If you were previously using past `expiration_ts` values to indicate IoC behavior, you must now explicitly set `time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel"` instead.

  Fixed the `GET /series` endpoint's tags parameter to properly support tags containing spaces. Previously, the parameter would split on both commas AND spaces, breaking searches for tags like "Rotten Tomatoes".

  **Breaking Change:**

  * The `tags` query parameter now **only** splits on commas (`,`), not spaces
  * Tags with spaces (e.g., "Rotten Tomatoes") now work correctly
  * Multiple tags must be comma-separated: `?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television`

  **Before (broken):**

  ```
  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes
  // Was incorrectly parsed as: ["Rotten", "Tomatoes"]
  // Result: No matches found
  ```

  **After (fixed):**

  ```
  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes
  // Correctly parsed as: ["Rotten Tomatoes"]
  // Result: Returns series with the "Rotten Tomatoes" tag

  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television
  // Correctly parsed as: ["Rotten Tomatoes", "Television"]
