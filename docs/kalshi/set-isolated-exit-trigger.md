        Fixed-point US dollar string. Most request fields accept 2-4 decimal

        carries a non-zero `filled_count` when it does. `active` is live and
        evaluated against the mark each tick. `filled`, `failed`, and `canceled`
        are terminal.

      description: >-
        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred
        to as "fp" in field names). Requests accept 0-2 decimal places (e.g.,
        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Fractional
        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported; the minimum granularity is
        0.01 contracts.
