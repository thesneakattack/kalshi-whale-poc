# Test In The Demo Environment

> Set up and test with Kalshi's demo environment

For testing purposes, Kalshi offers a *demo* environment with mock funds. You can access the Demo environment at [https://demo.kalshi.co/](https://demo.kalshi.co/). For safety, credentials are not shared between this environment and production.

<Warning>
  The price and behavior of markets in the demo environment may not be reflective of those in real markets.
</Warning>

To set up a Kalshi Demo account, [follow this step-by-step tutorial](https://help.kalshi.com/en/articles/13823775-creating-and-using-a-demo-account).

Demo's recommended Trade API root is `https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2`.
